There once was a man wearing lederhose and walking his hund.
While eating a gebaeck that he shared with his hund.
At the end of the street, they arrived at the biergarten to meet with their freunde.
It turns out the man is very wettbewerbsfaehig when it comes to gebaeck.
The man with his hund and fruende, they decided to go to the flughafen.
The man took his BMW and his fruende took his Audi; it was a race.
On the way they saw an advertisement for Rammstein playing at the local ratskeller.
They were very aufgeregt to see the stage in flammen stehen during the concert.
